        <h3>Do we share the information we receive?</h3>

        <h5>1) Third-party service providers</h5>
        We employ other companies and individuals to perform some functions on our behalf. These functions include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, delivering packages, analysing customer data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, and processing payments. For optimum fulfilment of these functions, they have access only to such customer information as is needed to perform their functions, and are contractually bound to not use it for any other purpose.
        <h5>2) Compliance with law</h5>
        We may be required to share customer information with government authorities and agencies for the purposes of verification of identity or for prevention, detection or investigation, including of cyber incidents, prosecution, and punishment of offences. Further, we may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of The Souled Store, our users or others.

        <h5>3) Business transfers</h5>
        As we develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.

        3) You can choose to not provide your personal information or consent for usage of your personal information, subsequently withdraw your consent or ask for deletion of your personal information.
